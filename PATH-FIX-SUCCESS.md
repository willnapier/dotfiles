# PATH FIX SUCCESS - Linux Bootstrap Issue SOLVED

## Problem
- Recurring "env: 'nu': No such file or directory" errors
- Systemd services couldn't start Nushell scripts
- PATH bootstrap circular dependency: Nushell needs PATH, but PATH is set by Nushell env.nu

## Solution Applied
- Created `dotter-sync-watcher-wrapper` with hardcoded shebang: `#!/home/will/.cargo/bin/nu`
- Bypasses PATH requirement entirely using absolute path to Nushell binary
- Pure Nushell solution maintaining architectural consistency
- Sources original script for full functionality

## Test Results
✅ Wrapper script executes successfully
✅ No more "nu: No such file or directory" errors
✅ PATH bootstrap issue permanently resolved

## Status: WORKING
