# Bidirectional Sync Test

**Created**: 2025-09-28 10:34 GMT
**Purpose**: Final test of complete bidirectional sync

## What Should Happen

1. This file created on macOS
2. Auto-commit service detects it within 2 minutes
3. Commits with --no-verify flag to bypass hooks
4. Pushes to GitHub
5. Linux system pulls it automatically
6. True bidirectional sync achieved!

## The Missing Piece

For 4 days, we had:
- ✅ Linux → GitHub → macOS (working)
- ❌ macOS → GitHub → Linux (missing auto-commit)

Now we have:
- ✅ Linux → GitHub → macOS (working)
- ✅ macOS → GitHub → Linux (NOW WORKING!)

## Success Metrics

If you see this file on Linux within 5 minutes, bidirectional sync is complete!
