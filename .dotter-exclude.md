# Dotter Exclusion Strategy
# Files that should NOT be managed by Dotter (generated, backup, or temporary files)

## Auto-Generated Files (Never manage these)
- `karabiner/automatic_backups/` - Auto-generated backups by Karabiner
- `karabiner/backups/` - Manual backups created during setup
- `nvim/doc/tags` - Generated by Neovim help system
- `nvim/last_session.vim` - Session file, auto-generated
- `nvim/spell/en.utf-8.add.spl` - Compiled spell file (auto-generated from .add)

## Backup Files (Historical, don't manage)
- `*.backup-*` - Any backup files with timestamps
- `*.bak` - Traditional backup files

## Development/Debug Files (Temporary)
- `nvim/lua/debug_telescope.lua` - Debug/development files
- `nvim/lua/telescope_filter_debug.lua` - Debug files
- `nvim/telescope_debug.lua` - Debug files

## Consider Managing (Review needed)
- `nvim/spell/en.utf-8.add` - Custom spell words (might want to sync across machines)
- Essential utility scripts that are actively used
- Plugin configurations that are customized

## Files Added to Management (2025-09-16)
✅ `aerospace/aerospace.toml` - Window manager config
✅ `ghostty/themes/solarized-*` - Custom themes
✅ `karabiner/karabiner.json` - Main keyboard config
✅ Essential Sketchybar files - Status bar config
✅ Key utility scripts - Actively used tools

## Strategy Summary
1. **Essential configs**: Add to Dotter for cross-machine sync
2. **Auto-generated**: Never add (would create conflicts)
3. **Backups**: Keep local, don't sync (historical reference)
4. **Custom data**: Case-by-case (like spell dictionaries)
